apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: db-migrations
  namespace: bookstore
data:
  # Note: This ConfigMap should be generated from the migrations/ directory
  # Run this command to create it:
  # kubectl create configmap db-migrations --from-file=migrations/ -n bookstore --dry-run=client -o yaml > kubernetes/migrations-configmap.yaml
  # 
  # For now, we'll apply migrations manually. A better approach is to:
  # 1. Build migrations into the app image
  # 2. Use an init container to run migrations
  # 3. Or use a proper migration tool like golang-migrate

# Cursor AI Rules for DemoApp Project

## Personal Development Documentation
- **NEVER** commit or push files in the `dev_docs/` directory
- These are personal development notes and should remain local only
- Files include: `diary.md`, `CONTINUITY.md`, `PLANNING.md`, `NEXT-SESSION.md`
- The `dev_docs/` directory is in `.gitignore` and should stay that way

## Git Workflow
- Always run `./test-smoke.sh` before committing
- Format Go code with `go fmt ./...` before committing
- Use descriptive commit messages following conventional commits format
- Personal documentation updates should NOT be committed to Git

## Testing Requirements
- All 16 smoke tests must pass before committing
- Run `docker compose down && docker compose up --build -d` to test changes
- Check both authenticated and anonymous user flows

## Code Quality
- Follow Go best practices and idioms
- Handle all errors properly (no unchecked returns)
- Use the Repository Pattern for all database access
- Keep handlers thin, business logic in repositories
